1) Write a function  that inputs a number and returns the product of digits of that number.

2) Write a function that finds the sum of proper divisors of a number. Proper divisors of a number are those numbers by which the number is divisible, except the number itself. For example proper divisors of 36 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 18

3) A number is called perfect if the sum of proper divisors of that number is equal to the number. For example 28 is perfect number, since 1+2+4+7+14=28. Write a program to print all the perfect numbers in a given range

4) Write a function that capitalizes the first and fourth letters of a name

5) Given an integer n, return True if n is within 10 of either 100 or 200
