Set the total to 0 to start with. While the total is 50 or less, ask the user to input a number. Add that number to the total 
and print the message "The total is... [total]". Stop the loop when the total is over 50.

Ask the user to enter a number. Keep asking until they enter a value over 5 and then display the message 
"The last number you entered was a [number]" and stop the program.

Ask the user to enter a number and then enter another number. Add these two numbers together and then ask if they want to add another number.
If they enter "y", ask them to enter another number and keep adding numbers until they do not answer "y".
Once the loop has stopped, display the total.

Ask for the name of somebody the user wants to invite to a party. After this, display the message "[name] has now been invited"
and add 1 to the count. Then ask if they want to invite somebody else. Keep repeating this until they no longer want to invite anyone
else to the party and then display how many people they have coming to the party.
