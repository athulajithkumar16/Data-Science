# Encryption question:

# Create a program that takes a number as input (e.g., 2) and an alphabet letter (either uppercase or lowercase). The output should be the letter that is the given number of positions ahead of the input letter in the alphabet. For example, if the input is 2 and the letter is 'A', the output should be 'C'. Similarly, for lowercase letters, if the input is 2 and the letter is 'a', the output should be 'c'. Bank domain:
number, alpha = input().strip()

def test(num,alp):
    num = int(num)
    if 90 < ord(alp)+num < 97:
        print(chr())
    elif ord(alp)+num > 122:
        print('Test')
    else:
        print(chr(ord(alp)+num))

test(number, alpha)

# Design a program for the bank domain where there are unlimited denominations of coins (e.g., 1, 2, 5, 10). The program takes an amount as input (e.g., 7) and calculates the minimum number of coins needed to sum up to that amount. For instance, if the input is 7, the output should be 2, as the minimum number of coins to make 7 is 2 (using one 5-coin and one 2-coin). Coding questions (first round)
# 1: implement a function to encode a given string by the following manner
# car - ect
# c -3 becomes  e-5 .
# +2 for each alphabet




# 2: given a list of numbers indicating the changes.
# Return minimum number of coin required to give the required amount. L1(interview)
